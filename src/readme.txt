muneco supports you managing a multilingual WordPress instance using a Network.


== Description ==

muneco is still under development.
It would be great if there will be some useful feedback!

muneco extends your WP-Network without manipulating the whole behaviour of the system. It can get activated or deactivated on the fly without destroying anything.

Discover what muneco can currently do for you:

* Connect Posts, Pages and Custom Post Types(in development) across the network
* Defining different language codes for Back- & Frontend
* Multilingual Sitemap
* Alternate hreflang annotations
* Recognize transitive connections


The modular architecture is a fantastic feature of muneco. Making it most flexible on doing it's job and gives you real control.

Every developer is invited contributing new modules or extending current ones. Have a look at the Overview module to get inspired by the architecture.

= Currently available Modules =

*	Sitemap
Provides a multilingual XML-Sitemap (/sitemap.xml) - ready for Google

*	Overview
Provides an overview of your Connections


= Currently planned Modules =

* Support for MO-Files to translate static text

If you are not happy with MuNeCo, you can uninstall it without getting into troubles with your site. The Network will work on, just without connections.


== Installation ==

Installing MuNeCo is as simple as using it.

1. Upload `MuNeCo` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the Network-Adminscreen

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
